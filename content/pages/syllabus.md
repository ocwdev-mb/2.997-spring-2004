Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Topic Coverage
--------------

Topic coverage will be adapted according to students' interests. Some or all of the following will be covered:

Markov Decision Processes and Dynamic Programming (2-3 weeks)

*   Stochastic Models, Dynamic Programming Theory, Value and Policy Iteration.

Simulation-Based Methods (2 weeks)

*   Asynchronous Value and Policy Iteration, Q-Learning, Complexity of Reinforcement Learning. Revision of underlying tools such as Lyapunov Function Analysis and the ODE Approach.

Value Function Approximation (4 weeks)

*   TD-Learning, Approximate Linear Programming, Performance Bounds, Theory of Function Approximation.

Policy Search Methods (2-3 weeks)

*   Policy Gradient and Actor-Critic Methods. Complexity of Policy Search.

Online Learning and Games (2 weeks)

*   Experts Algorithms, Regret Minimization and Calibration.

We will see applications throughout the course, including dynamic resource allocation, finance and queuing networks, among others.

Term Project
------------

Students will be offered the option of working on theory, algorithms and/or applications. Project proposals will be submitted midway through the term, with the final project due at the end of the term.

A 10-15 page project report and 15-20 minute presentation are required.
